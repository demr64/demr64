## Hello there 
I'm a Bachelor's Computer Science student at UNISA (University of Salerno). I'm currently exploring different areas of Computing.
I mainly code in Python and C/C++ but I'm versatile, as I also know some Javascript, PHP, SQL and Minizinc.

## Current interests ðŸ”­
My current interests lie in the fields of both theoretical and applied Machine Learning, Cybersecurity and Cryptography and Computational Mathematics.
